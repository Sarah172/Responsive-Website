          <h4>08 January 2021, Grogu</h4>
          <p>
            Dalhousie University and the Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA)
            have successfully reached a tentative collective agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bargaining teams met with the government conciliator today
            (Friday, January 8) and successfully resolved the remaining
            outstanding items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parties would like to extend thanks to all bargaining team
            members who volunteered their time to be involved in this important
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            A tentative agreement means that both parties have agreed to the
            terms of a collective agreement, which need to be agreed to or
            ratified by the DFA members and the university’s Board. The details
            of the tentative deal will be made available once the Board and the
            membership of DFA have ratified the collective agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            DFA represents approximately 1,000 full-time faculty, instructors,
            librarians and counselors at Dalhousie.

            Now that the daily COVID-19 case numbers have finally started to
            reduce, we seem to have managed the second wave reasonably well
            here. This was a good sign for restaurants and fitness centres in
            the city, which opened on January 4 after a brief lockdown. Click

          <h3>Opinion: Online teaching vs. emergency remote teaching</h3>
          <h4>12 January 2021, Grogu</h4>
          <p>
            While we may all be operating under the assumption that teaching has
            quickly transformed into online teaching during this pandemic and
            that this mode of teaching has not always been the most effective,
            it may be because of a few different reasons: (a) we are still in
            the middle of a pandemic and our daily stresses from this experience
            impact how we experience various things, including classes; (b) this
            mode of teaching requires additional training, infrastructure and
            support, and (c) this is still remote teaching in the middle of a
            pandemic and changes to courses are possible in small increments.
            This can lead to frustration among students and helplessness among
            teachers. In this opinion piece, Grogu writes about the
            <!-- This paragraph contains an empty hyperlink. -->

              differences between online teaching and emergency remote teaching

            , and discusses lessons we can take away from our collective
            experience.

          <h3>Opinion: #WearAMask – it is for the others in the community</h3>
          <h4>11 January 2021, Leia Organa</h4>
          <p>
            Masks are useful, mainly because while we may not be symptomatic
            ourselves, we may still be carrying the coronavirus and unknowingly
            give it to others. This is an important aspect to remember now that
            vaccinations are underway, because even after you are vaccinated,
            you should continue to wear a mask until a large majority of the
            population has been vaccinated. Follow public health guidelines,
            physical distance and wear a mask when you’re outside. Remember,
            we’re all in the same storm but not on the same boat: how this
            pandemic impacts each of us is very different depending on our
            individual differences. Let’s honour and respect these differences
            and support each other. Wear a mask.
